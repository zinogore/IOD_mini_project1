# IOD_mini_project1
IOD mini project that encapsulate modules 1-3

Intructions:
1. Git Version Control:
   - Initialize a Git repository for the project to track code changes
   - Commit code changes related to data preprocessing, analysis, and database integration.
   
2. Environment Management:
   - Use environments to manage project dependencies and ensure a consistent environment for all contributors.
   - Use a requirements.txt file to document and share the required dependencies (should be part of the git file).

3. Data Retrieval:
   - Use Python and its libraries (e.g., requests) to build a dataset using a public API.
   - Example: You can use this api : https://covid-api.com/api/
   
4. Data Preprocessing:
   - Generate the summary on missing values 
   - Document any inconsistencies and potential outliers
   - Clean and preprocess the retrieved data to handle missing values, inconsistencies and potential outliers.
   
5. SQL Database Integration:
   - Set up a SQL database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL) using Python and store the preprocessed data into the database.
   
6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Load the preprocessed data from the database 
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis using Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to visualize and summarize the vaccination data.
   - Create visualizations (e.g., line plots, bar charts, heatmaps) to identify trends and patterns.
   
7. Conclusion and Reporting:
   - Summarize the findings of the EDA.
   - Include visualizations, key statistics.
   
Output expected:

1)  Github link to a repository that contains the following:
i)  code
ii) info to reproduce environment
iii)All your notebooks
iv) final report can be of any presentable format - html, ppt, word, pdf
v)  Readme file - Readme file should contain a summary of the project and the steps to reproduce your code
